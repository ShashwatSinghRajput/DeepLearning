 [**1. Forecasting stock price using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - December 2021**](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Deep_Learning/blob/main/RNN/An_LSTM_to_predict_trend_in_stock_prices.ipynb)

**Situation:** Forecast next 18 day stock price of GOOG from historical data

**Task:** Formulate ML solution, Python Programming, Feature Scaling, Specify Timesteps, Build-Initialize-Train multi-layered RNN from Keras library

**ML Approach**: LSTM/Recurring Neural Networks (RNN), Dropout Regularization to avoid overfitting, RMSprop optimizer, Supervised Machine Learning
 
**Result:** Loss function converges at 0.0016. ML model captures smooth price changes, but fails to integrate volatility and spikes in the forecast
