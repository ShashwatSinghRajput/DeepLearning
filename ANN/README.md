[**1. Forecast electrical energy output of a Power Plant using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)	(October 2021)**](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Deep_Learning/blob/main/ANN/Regression/ANN_for_Regression.ipynb)

  **Situation:** 
      Predict net-hourly electrical energy output over next 15 months 
  
  **Task:** 
  Forge ML model in Python, Pre-process data, Build-Initialise-Train sequential ANN from Keras Tensorflow library
  
  **ML Approach:**
  Time-Series forecasting, ANN-Regression, Optimize Loss function (RMSE) via Backpropagation (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
  
  **Result:**
  RMSE convergence achieved in 26-27 range. Predicted hourly-output proximate to actual values


[**2. Churn Modelling for a Bank using Logistic Regression	(November 2021)**](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Deep_Learning/blob/main/ANN/Classification/ANN_for_Classification.ipynb)


 **Situation:**
     Predict whether bank’s client would continue with service or not 6 months hence

 **Task:**
    Explore ML Classification methods, cleanse data , encode categorical data, Initialise, Compile and Train Neural Network by batch learning; Confusion Matrix

**ML Approach:**
ANN-Classification, Logistic Regression, Sigmoid activation, Adam optimizer, Binary Crossentropy, Supervised Machine Learning

**Result:**
The model predicted with 85% accuracy whether bank’s customers would jump ship or stay
