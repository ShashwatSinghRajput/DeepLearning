[**Churn Modelling for a Bank using Logistic Regression	(November 2021)**](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Deep_Learning/blob/main/ANN/Classification/ANN_for_Classification.ipynb)


 **Situation:**
     Predict whether bank’s client would continue with service or not 6 months hence

 **Task:**
    Explore ML Classification methods, cleanse data , encode categorical data, Initialise, Compile and Train Neural Network by batch learning; Confusion Matrix

**ML Approach:**
ANN-Classification, Logistic Regression, Sigmoid activation, Adam optimizer, Binary Crossentropy, Supervised Machine Learning

**Result:**
The model predicted with 85% accuracy whether bank’s customers would jump ship or stay
